<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->

## About the Project

<!-- header image of project -->

![image1][image1]

### Project Description

Fruts is an interactive, chart-based website that provides detailed insights into the nutrition & price trends of various fruits. Apart from fun facts and info about each fruit on the home page, the platform offers two additional pages; the first, a comparative view where 2 fruits’ nutritional info are compared with engaging visualisations. Secondly, users can explore the historical pricing of fruits in Europe on the timeline page. The site is a great tool for health enthusiasts, nutritionists, and anyone with a love for fruit.
